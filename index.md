# Welcome to Our GPU and CPU Programming Project 

This is an innovative platform dedicated to advancing GPU and CPU programming, parallelization, and deep/machine learning. Designed to harness the power of modern computing hardware, it serves developers, data scientists, and researchers looking to optimize performance and efficiency in their computational tasks.

## About the Project

Our project, named Gaussian Elimination, is built using cutting-edge technologies like CUDA, OPENMP, MPI, Pthreads. We offer features such as [describe key features, like parallel computing capabilities, machine learning libraries, etc.]. This platform is ideal for users who are involved in [describe the ideal use case or user, like high-performance computing, data analysis, AI model training, etc.].
